- started with reading 'building llm from scratch' book , halfway through 2nd chapter 
- realised need to learn pytorch went to learn pytorch there i realised first need to learn numpy
- learnt numpy from blog by sebastian raschka 
- realised i need to learn ml first before reading book
- did first 3 lectures of cs229 also read notes for it 
- realised math is heavy and i need to learn math first 
- went for cs109 (for probability) with intention to complete it and go for cs224n
- while doing cs109 on side did following stuff
	- built todo list in django
	- markdown editor with html and javascript (very little not even worth calling project)
	- python script to post from terminal using twitter api and tweepy 
	- watched 2 videos from 'backend from scratch'
	- also tried to read 'math for ml' book and felt its language is bit dense
- did 15 lectures of cs109 learned probability and probabilistic models random variables and stuff
- felt it might be enough 
- started learning pytorch from 'pytorch in a day' video 
- completed like 8 hours of lecture which was like two chapters, also did exercises for them and read through extra-curriculum stuff
- while doing this pytorch lectures did following extra stuff
